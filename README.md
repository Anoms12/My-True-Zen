A truly _Zen_ theme for [Zen Browser](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop)

## ⚠️ Warnings
Tab groups are an experimental feature and you may encounter bugs, for more info please see my other project, [Advanced Tab Groups](https://github.com/Anoms12/Advanced-Tab-Groups)

## Features

1. **URL Bar**

    * A seemless URL bar, this has a `max-width` of `400px` and you can scroll inside of the bar to accsess all of the content
    * Glance like background effects¹, giving a themed background and a slight unfocus on the page.
      
2. **Cleaner Menus**

  * Every menu has been refined with a better color, `rgba(0, 0, 0, .90)`, to create the most peacful experience possible
  * Some specific menus have a better layout such as the tabs context menu²
      
4. **Fresh animations**
     * This rice comes packed with cleaner transitions for most things you do in the browser, such as swiching tabs, opening the URL Bar and hovering over most items. If you find somthing without a peacful animation please create an issue and I will get one created.
